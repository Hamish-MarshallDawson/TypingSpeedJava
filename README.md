# Word Per Minute (WPM) Program
This Java program is designed to measure a user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM). It prompts the user to select a difficulty level (Low, Medium, or High), generates a random set of words based on the chosen difficulty, and then measures the user's typing speed.

## How to Use
### 1. Difficulty Selection:

The program will prompt you to select a difficulty level: Low (L), Medium (M), or High (H).
Enter the corresponding letter for your desired difficulty.
### 2. Countdown:

After selecting the difficulty, a countdown from 3 will begin to prepare you for the typing test.
Typing Test:

A set of words will be displayed based on the chosen difficulty.
Type the displayed words as quickly and accurately as possible.
### 3. Results:

After completing the typing test, the program will display the time taken and your words per minute (WPM) score.
## Difficulty Levels
Low (L):

Short set of words for beginners.
Medium (M):

Medium-length set of words for moderate difficulty.
High (H):

Challenging set of words covering a wide range for advanced users.
## Additional Information
The program uses java.util.Random to randomize word selection.
It measures the time taken for the user to complete the typing test.
WPM is calculated based on the time taken and the length of the typed words.
The user is provided with a final result showing the time taken and WPM.
